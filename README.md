Who Wants To Be A Javalionaire
==============================

This project came from the idea of making a completly different type of presentation for Academia de CÃ³digo's daily presentation of last day's summary. Instead of a regular powerpoint presentation, I decided to program a contest and ask 3 colleagues to play and answer the questions for me, about Thread Safety, as I knew little about it.

What was meant to be a way to pass out the fireball, turned out to be a very positive learning experience as I had to answer all the question by myself because my colleagues didn't answered them correctly. Result: I found out I've actually learned about Thread Safety. Which later on gave me an idea for a future project.

This Project was done from 1am to 4am so the structure is prety bad as I just wanted a functional product. It needs a total refactor!!! Actually I will do it all over from scratch again, to restructure the whole project once I have time available.

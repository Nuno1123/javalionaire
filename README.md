Who Wants To Be A Javalionaire
==============================

This project is originated in the idea of making a completly different type of presentation for Academia de CÃ³digo's daily presentation of last day's summary. Instead of a regular powerpoint presentation, I deided to program a contest to call 3 colleagues to play and answer the questions for me, about Thread Safety, as I knew little about it.

What was to be a way to pass out the fireball, turned out to be a very positive learning experience as I had to answer all the question because my colleagues didn't answered correctly. Result, I found out I've actually learned about it. Which later gave an idea for a future project.

This Project was done from 1am to 4am. It needs a total refactor!!! Actually I will, do it from scratch again, to restructure it once I have time available.
